Dear MobileCTS Team,

Thank you for the oppurtunity.

I created this application using Django and Bootstrap.

Kindly install django before setting up the application.
Once done, Kindly use the command python manage.py runserver to run the server.

All the other features are designed as per the requirements.

You can open admin panel by typing /admin in the site.
